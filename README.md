# [RH2] CPERS: Arrest Here! (1.6 Update)

This is a **reimplementation** of the [original "[RH2] CPERS: Arrest Here!" mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2563157350) for RimWorld, updated to support **version 1.6**.

In RimWorld 1.5, the original mod added a Float Menu option via **Harmony patching**.  
However, as of RimWorld 1.6, this functionality can now be added using the **native `FloatMenuOptionProvider` system**, which this mod takes full advantage of.

---

## âœ… Features

- Adds a **Arrest Here** Float Menu option when right-clicking on downed pawns.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Differences from the Original Mod

- The Float Menu is built using RimWorld 1.6's **native modding API**, not the Harmony Patch.
- Refactored and cleaned up logic for better compatibility with the new FloatMenu system.
- Fully compatible with other FloatMenuOptionProviders in 1.6.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This is **not an official update** by the original author.
- This version was rebuilt by reviewing and understanding the original modâ€™s functionality, then adapting it using new 1.6 tools.
- The mod should be safe to use in existing saves, but always back up your game just in case.
